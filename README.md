# Coding Quiz 
-OVERVIEW-
For this project I created a quiz about coding.The user has 60 seconds (1 minute) to complete this quiz; consisting of 5 multiple choice questions that upon selections an question option provides a 'correct' or "incorrect' result; if the option chosen is 'incorrect' then 10 seconds are deducted from the timer. 

The quiz will end when the time expires or the quiz is completed. Once the quiz ends, there will be a score computed with an opportunity to store users high score using their initials.
